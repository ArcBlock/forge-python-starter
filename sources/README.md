## Installation

### Initialize the repo

Run `make init` to initialize the repository with required front-end libraries.

### Python installation

It's recommended that you start a fresh python environment for this project to avoid dependencies conflict, you can run `make create-env` to create one with all required dependencies installed.

If you prefer to install python dependencies in your current environment, you can run `make install`. This will install required python dependencies.

```bash
make declare
```

## Usage

Start python server on 5000. If you ran `make create-env` before, run `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh;workon forge-env;` before you run below command:

```bash
make run-server
```

Run client on port 3000

```bash
make run-client
```
